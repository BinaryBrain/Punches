Punches
=======

Punches is a tool to create holes in your web pages. It works only with some CSS3 and a few lines of HTML.

Usage
=====

You only need the file `punches.less` to make it work.  
Other files are for testing purpose.

### HTML

```
<div class="punch" style="">
  <div class="white">
    <div class="in">
      <div class="content">
	    <!-- Put your content here if you want to. -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### LESS

```
@import "punches";
```

Dependencies
============

Punches needs [LESS](http://lesscss.org) to work.
